Application: JentExchange (Laravel)

Purpose: Small marketplace for Jewish entertainers. Users can sign up via Google OAuth
and create entertainer profiles which include profile and background images, pricing,
types, audiences, and video links.

Key paths and components:
- App root: /home/yehudaj/jentexchange/app
- Public files served from: /home/yehudaj/jentexchange/app/public
- Storage (public disk): storage/app/public (symlinked at public/storage)
- Entertainer model: App\Models\Entertainer
- Upload handling: App\Http\Controllers\EntertainerController
  - store() handles initial signup upload
  - update() handles profile edits and file uploads
  - Uses Laravel `store('entertainer/profile','public')` and `store('entertainer/backgrounds','public')`

Current environment and debugging notes (as of 2025-12-14):
- Apache running and listening on 0.0.0.0:80, 0.0.0.0:443 inside WSL
- Windows `wslrelay` forwards localhost requests via IPv6 ::1; IPv4->IPv6 portproxy added
- PHP upload_max_filesize and post_max_size set to 50M
- Storage symlink `public/storage` -> `storage/app/public` exists
- PHP sqlite driver installed (php8.2-sqlite3)

Upload troubleshooting checklist:
1. Ensure `public/storage/entertainer-uploads` exists and is writable by web user (www-data).
2. Ensure PHP `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` are large enough for images.
3. Check Laravel logs (storage/logs/laravel.log) for validation or storage errors.
4. Use debug upload route `/debug/controller-upload/{entertainer}` to test without auth/CSRF.

How to resume:
- Start Apache in WSL and ensure `wslrelay`/portproxy forwarding is active on Windows.
- Run a debug upload and inspect `storage/app/public/entertainer-uploads` for new files.

Contact: leave output and logs in storage/logs/laravel.log and I will continue debugging.
